A cool little repl-based simulation written in Python planned to integrate machine-learning into itself to have AI battle to the death before your eyes. The project contains a front-end, as well as a main() file that completely controls the grid and can be used anywhere. In the future, this could become a module. Overall, this is simply a cool little project.
